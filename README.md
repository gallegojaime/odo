# odo
The customizable productivity tool.

> Odo helps you out achieving your goals in your personal, effective way.

## What motivates it

Productivity-minded people use checklists, calendars, or paradigms such as GTD often. They may work well for you or they may be a disaster.

What Odo provides is an alternative to the locked, proprietary paradigms of productivity apps - and gives you a tool that you can morph to your liking.

## It's open-source
Suggestions and contributions are tremendously useful for Odo. Clone it, modify it, give back: our permissive license allows you to do that and more.
